<p style="text-align:justify;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman,serif;font-size:16px;">History of CFL</span></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><strong></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:40px;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman,serif;font-size:16px;">The College of Foreign Languages of Nankai University was founded in October, 1997. Its predecessor was Nankai English Department, founded in 1919. Renowned poet, Professor Chen Kui, who graduated from Nebraska University in America, worked as the dean in 1919. In the next year, a famous scholar named Liu Wuji, son of Liu Yazi, PhD from Yale University, succeeded Professor Chen Kui as the dean. In late 1932, Situ Yuelan, Master from California University, came to teach in English Department. In 1937, since Anti-Japanese War broke out, English Department moved southward to Kunming, merged with Foreign Literature Departments from Qianghua University and Beijing University, and became the renowned Foreign Literature Department of National Southwestern Associated University.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:40px;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">In 1949, with the birth of new China, English Department of Nankai University also acquired a new lease of life. With the addition of Russian major under the approval of State Ministry of Higher Education in 1950, English Department developed into Foreign Languages Department. Zhou Enlai, distinguished alumnus of Nankai University and the first Prime Minister of China came back to Nankai University in 1959 for a visit. He talked to teachers and students from Foreign Languages Department when he visited the department’s classrooms. This greatly inspired teachers and students from the department. In 1972, approved by State Ministry of Education, Foreign Languages Department established its Japanese major. Encouraged by the university, Translation Research Center, British and American Literature Research Center, and Russian Literature Research Center were established in 1980s. In 1980, the major of English Language and Literature and the major of Russian Language and Literature began to have the right to grant master degree after China&nbsp;began to adopt its&nbsp;degree system; the major of Japanese Language and Literature also began to have the right to grant master degree in 1986. In 1990, approved by State Education Commission, the major of English Language and Literature began to grant doctoral degree. In 2001, approved by State Ministry of Education, College of Foreign Languages (CFL) launched French major. In 2002, CFL began to offer German major undergraduate program. In the same year, Translation Department was founded. In 2003, Post-doctoral Research Center for foreign languages and literature was established. In the same year, the major of foreign linguistics and applied linguistics began to grant master degree. In 2007, CFL began to grant English MTI (Master of Translation and Interpreting) degree. In 2011, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council acknowledged</span><span style="font-size:16px;">CFL’s Foreign Language and Literature program as first-class discipline to grant doctoral degrees. Russian and Japanese major had the right to grant doctoral degree since then. In 2013, CFL set up Spanish major. In 2014, CFL began to grant Japanese MTI degree. In 2015, Naikai University and Glasgow University’s Joint Graduate School set up translation major. Foreign language and literature has been one the key disciplines of Tianjin.</span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:40px;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman,serif;font-size:16px;">Over more than 90 years, many noted scholars have taught in CFL, for example, Liu Wuji, Chen Kui, Situ Yuelan, Situ Rukun, Liang Zongdai, Feng Wenqian, Huang Zuolin, Huang Yusheng, Bian Zhilin, Luo Dagang, Zha Liangzheng (Mu Dan), Li Jiye, Li Yixie, Wu Kunning, Yang Shanquan, Cao Zhongde, Zong Yucai, Gao Diansen, Li Shuguo, Jin Di, Chang Yaoxin, Liu Shicong, Gu Hengdong (Gu Yu), Cui Yonglu, Zhang Zhiting, Zhang Maizeng, and so on.

These graduates have made great contribution to China’s diplomacy, foreign affairs, education, economy and trade, administration, culture, military and so on, earning widespread acclaim from employer and society. Many of them are significant members in promoting the development of the country and society.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:40px;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman,serif;font-size:16px;">From 1951 to 1982, Professor Li Jiye, famous writer and translator, student and comrade of Mr. Lu Xun, was working as the Dean.

In the meantime, it tries to enrich the scope of each discipline and has established new disciplinary territories in Cross-cultural Studies and Regional and National Studies, making it possible for the extension of students’ scope of knowledge and new academic advantages. CFL can always cater to the needs of social development. New majors and language programs are launched, and new teachers and scholars are drawn to work in the college that is now renowned for its overall development and competitiveness in student education and academic exploration. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman,serif;font-size:16px;">CFL insists on promoting students&#39; ability and initiatives. We believe that the overall development of students is the most important part of students’ education. We try to enhance students’ creativity and students’ ability to put what they learn into practice. We keep updating our way of education, strengthening students&#39; knowledge of languages, and broadening their academic horizon. We have very modern methodology for language education and have long enjoyed exceedingly good quality in students&#39; cultivation. Students in CFL have great performance all throughout the years in various language qualification tests for English, Japanese, Russian, French, and German. What is more, while they have great skills in using languages, they also, through their education here, adopt great understandings of life and value. The knowledge of humanities is central to their education here. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;-ms-text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman,serif;font-size:16px;">In 2010, CFL&#39;s College English Course was entitled National Level Quality Course.

Besides its efforts in education, CFL is always strengthening its academic advantages. There is a package of measures and policies to encourage teachers to take part in academic activities abroad and at home.
